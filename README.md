## 🎯 About

This weather application was built as a **learning project** to gain hands-on experience with React and its ecosystem. The project demonstrates real-world application development by integrating multiple modern libraries and best practices.

### Why This Project?

- **Practical Learning:** Building a real application rather than following simple tutorials
- **Industry Standards:** Using tools and patterns used in production environments
- **Full Stack Thinking:** Understanding API integration and data flow
- **Modern React:** Implementing hooks, context, and functional components
